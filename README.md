# Spring Boot Testing

# This is a Spring Boot project designed **specifically for testing and validating REST controller functionality**, with a focus on **HTTP GET and POST methods**. It is meant for learning, experimentation, and understanding how to test RESTful endpoints in a Spring Boot environment using best practices.

## Purpose

The core goals of this project are:
- To demonstrate **unit and integration testing** for REST controllers.
- To simulate **HTTP GET** and **POST** requests using tools like `RestTemplate`, and `WebTestClient`.
- To illustrate test setup, configuration, and assertions in a Spring context.
